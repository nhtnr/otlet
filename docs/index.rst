**Otlet**, is a zero-dependency, pure-python wrapper for the PyPI JSON Web API. It was created mainly for
use with the `otlet-cli  <https://pypi.org/project/otlet-cli/>`_ tool, but it also works great as a standalone module.

   pip install -U otlet

You can also download the CLI tool with::

   pip install -U otlet[cli]
